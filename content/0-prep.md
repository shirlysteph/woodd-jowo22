We invite submissions to the First Workshop on Geospatial Knowledge Graphs (GeoKG2022) to be held in conjunction with the 
<a href="https://www.knowledgegraph.tech/">The Knowledge Graph Conference 2022 (KGC2022)</a> that will take place at Cornell Tech campus, New York, 
and globally online, from May 2 to 6, 2022. GeoKG2022 is a half-day workshop consisting of two parts: paper presentations, and an interactive breakout
discussion session.

The workshop aims to bring together disparate elements of the environmental and geospatial community and provide a setting to discourse about
large-scale knowledge graphs for geospatial and environmental data integration and intelligence, state-of-the-art, spatiotemporally-explicit machine
learning methods, tools, and their potential as well as limitations on addressing geospatial challenges. More specifically, the goal is to foster
discussion on frameworks for leveraging spatial and temporal knowledge as the nexus to integrate environmental data of various themes within geospatial
knowledge graphs.


## Topics:
We particularly welcome contributions on topics related to environmental data integration using knowledge graphs and geospatial 
intelligence services using innovative machine learning techniques. The main topics of interest are:


1) Geospatial Ontologies and Geospatial Knowledge Graph Construction
    - Spatiotemporal Scoping of GKGs
    - Ontologies to encode environmental observations and events in GeoKGs

2) Querying Geospatial Knowledge Graphs
    - GeoSPARQL and Spatial Query Evaluation
    - GeoKGs Visualizations

3) Machine Learning for Geospatial Knowledge Graphs
    - Geospatial Knowledge Graph Embeddings
    - Spatiotemporally-explicit Machine Learning Models for Environmental Tasks

4) Other GeoKG Topics and Applications
    - Real-world use cases of GeoKGs
    - Applications of Geospatial Knowledge Graphs (e.g. knowledge graphs in environmental data integration and AI systems)

## Submissions:

We encourage three types of contributions:

• Full research paper: Submitted papers must not exceed 14 pages excluding the bibliography. Please, note that the minimum length is 10 pages.

• Short paper: Submitted papers must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography. Please, note that the minimum length is 5 pages (including the bibliography).

• Extended abstracts (presentation only) should be 2-4 pages long including the bibliography. Please, note that extended abstracts will not be included in the CEUR proceedings.


All papers must be original and not submitted to or accepted by any other workshop, conference or journal. Note, that for inclusion in the JOWO proceedings, short and position
papers are required to be at least 5 pages long. All contributions will be peer-reviewed, and the review process will be managed in a collaborative and transparent manner using 
the EasyChair System. 

The submission link is https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jowo2022


Papers should be submitted non-anonymously in PDF format in compliance with the new 1-column CEUR-ART Style. Word and Latex templates can be found at
