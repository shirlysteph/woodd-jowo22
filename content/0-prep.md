We invite submissions to the Workshop On Ontologies for the Disaster Domain (WOODD) to be held at <a href="https://www.iaoa.org/jowo/2022/index.html">The Joint Ontology 
WOrkshops (JOWO)</a> that will take place at Jönköping University, Jönköping, Sweden, from August 15 to 19, 2022. The workshop will mainly consist of paper presentations, 
and interactive breakout discussion session.



## Topics:
Integrated management of heterogeneous hazard- and disaster-related datasets is key to efficient and effective preparation, and response to disasters requires discussing some
the crucial domain and formal aspects that need to be addressed during modeling. We intend to solicit topics and discussion from both a <em>domain centric</em> direction, 
as well as through discussion on the underlying <em>formal mechanisms.</em> This includes:
	
1) Ontologies that focus on modeling the following aspects of the domain
	<ul>
	  <li>reference ontology or not?</li>
	  <li>key phases of disaster management life cycle,</li>
	  <li>connecting core hazard terms (e.g. disaster, risk) and operational concepts (e.g. response task, relief plan),</li>
	  <li>modeling different spatial-temporal views, such as point, area, or trajectory phenomenon,</li>
	  <li>linking observational data to hazard events,</li>
	  <li>modeling causal chains for compounding disasters and disaster impacts,</li>
	  <li>showing ontology use.</li>
	</ul>  

2) Foundational issues
	<ul>
	  <li>clarifying ontological choices for modeling domain terminology against requirements and foundational theory,</li>
	  <li>kinds of entities: abstract/concret, dependent entities/independent entities, natural objects/artifacts,</li>
	  <li>formal relations: parthood, identity, connection, dependence, constitution, causality, subsumption, instantiation</li>
	</ul>
3) Construction and annotation of domain taxonomies or vocabularies using machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies

4) Ontology integration and ontology alignmemt

5) Ontology modularity

6) Ontologies and disaster domain knowledge graphs


Submissions are particularly welcome that address aspects of this theme, but submissions outside of the theme, but maintain the core idea of the workshop are also welcome.

### Submissions:

We encourage three types of contributions:

<ul>
  <li><em>Full research paper:</em> Submitted papers must not exceed 14 pages excluding the bibliography. Please, note that the minimum length is 10 pages.</li>
  <li><em>Short paper:</em> Submitted papers must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography. Please, note that the minimum length is 5 pages (including the bibliography).</li>
  <li><em>Extended abstracts (presentation only)</em> should be 2-4 pages long including the bibliography. Please, note that extended abstracts will not be included in the CEUR proceedings.</li>
</ul>  

All papers must be original and not submitted to or accepted by any other workshop, conference or journal. Note, that for inclusion in the JOWO proceedings, short and position
papers are required to be at least 5 pages long. All contributions will be peer-reviewed, and the review process will be managed in a collaborative and transparent manner using 
the EasyChair System.
