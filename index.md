There is an increasing interest in semantically integrating diverse and heterogeneous hazard data-sets, along with representing hazard information in knowledge graphs. However, 
there are still significant deficiencies in state-of-the-art ontologies that can represent and connect hazard data across independent sources and variant schemas, for example, 
due to ambiguities in the interpretation of data, different and incompatible ontological commitments, the lack of web accessibility and clear identifiers for their terms, and 
insufficient metadata. Also, most hazard '\emph{domain}' ontologies are inadequate for providing insight, through formal logic-supported inferencing, into the processes and 
relationships involved in the Natural Hazard-Disaster dynamic. 

Recent trends indicate that the risks of natural hazards leading to disasters with impacts on human life and property are further exacerbated by rapid urbanization and climate 
change. The huge volume of hazard-related data made available from many disparate sources, sensors, and techniques to predict and describe natural hazard events and their related 
impacts are highly heterogeneous in structure and semantics. This leads to huge challenges in developing effective, evidence-based strategies for the mitigation, preparedness, 
response, and recovery from natural hazards that result in disasters. Integrated management of these heterogeneous hazard- and disaster-related datasets is key to efficient and 
effective preparation and response to disasters requires discussing some the following crucial domain and formal aspects that need to be addressed during modeling.

In order to address these issues, we propose a workshop centered around the following topics. We intend to solicit topics and discussion from both a \emph{domain centric} 
direction, as well as through discussion on the underlying \emph{formal mechanisms.} \textit{Domain aspects} include: \textbf{(1)} covering all key phases of disaster management 
life cycle,\textbf{ (2)} connecting core hazard terms (from hazard and disaster ontologies) and operational concepts (from emergency management and hazard mitigation ontologies), 
\textbf{(3)} modeling different spatial-temporal views, such as point, area, or trajectory phenomenon, \textbf{(4)} linking observational data to hazard events, \textbf{(5)} 
abstract classes that can serve as the underpinning for taxonomic hierarchies (hazard classification, relief/response categories) of core concepts. \textit{Formal mechanisms} 
include: \textbf{(1)} use of domain-independent concepts from upper ontologies for consistent use of terminology, for alignment, and for interoperability, \textbf{(2)} modeling 
causal chains to enable more holistic understanding of inter-dependencies across different terminologies or events, \textbf{(3)} modularization. This workshop will bring together 
knowledge modeling engineers, domain ontology experts, developers of disaster knowledge graphs to discuss different techniques and rationale 
for constructing various ontologies in the disaster domain. This will potentially also set the stage for opening the floor for discussion about limitations of existing research, 
missing pieces, and overall address a key question "\emph{Do we need a domain ontology or a reference ontology for the hazard domain}"?
