There is an increasing interest in semantically integrating diverse and heterogeneous hazard data-sets, along with representing hazard information in knowledge graphs. However, 
there are still significant deficiencies in state-of-the-art ontologies that can represent and connect hazard data across independent sources and variant schemas, for example, 
due to ambiguities in the interpretation of data, different and incompatible ontological commitments, the lack of web accessibility and clear identifiers for their terms, and 
insufficient metadata. Also, most hazard '\emph{domain}' ontologies are inadequate for providing insight, through formal logic-supported inferencing, into the processes and 
relationships involved in the Natural Hazard-Disaster dynamic. 

Recent trends indicate that the risks of natural hazards leading to disasters with impacts on human life and property are further exacerbated by rapid urbanization and climate 
change. The huge volume of hazard-related data made available from many disparate sources, sensors, and techniques to predict and describe natural hazard events and their related 
impacts are highly heterogeneous in structure and semantics. This leads to huge challenges in developing effective, evidence-based strategies for the mitigation, preparedness, 
response, and recovery from natural hazards that result in disasters. Integrated management of these heterogeneous hazard- and disaster-related datasets is key to efficient and 
effective preparation and response to disasters requires discussing some the following crucial domain and formal aspects that need to be addressed during modeling.
